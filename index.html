  <h2>A human depends on his environment but only he himself is albe to create it around him and for himself </h2>
<p>
I consider myself lucky, because my work coincides with my hobby. My education and many years of experience have helped me to develop a specific prioritization system in my work.
First and foremost development starts with a conceptual design which must fit the architecture of the surrounding buildings, its practical uses and be in harmony with the rest of the area.
Also scrutinous approach to the piculiarities of every plot of land (such as the type of soil, its depth, the humidity, whether there are any special landforms, the environment) and many other aspects keeping in mind the weather differences in our seasons.
And last but not least is the attention to the wishes and preferences of the client.
And of course the continious decorative view of the garden thoughout the year.
To realize it all in practice I work with a team of professional gardeners, dendrologists (botanists specialized in bigger plants and trees), agriculteral technicians, irigation and water object experts.

It seems to me that I understand what Tatyana created on our small plot near the house.

         because it is impossible to take your eyes off this beauty, blooming in its order and harmoniously combined.
         Interweaving of coniferous and deciduous plants, delicate colors (without pretentiousness), beautiful pebbles in the landscape,
which reminds me that the sea should be close and even spicy
herbs for tea at our feet - all this creates an incredible atmosphere of comfort and bliss.
What else can I say...if only we had at least a little more land at our disposal,
I would not hesitate to give it to Tatyana for decorative plants, because I consider her a professional with a capital P.

          The first time we used Tanya's services was on the advice of friends - we visited them and admired the design of the site. We liked everything - the selection of plants, the compatibility and filling of the flower beds and, most importantly, the modern style without “ruffles and curls.” And now we have been cooperating for three years, or rather, <span id='more2'> . . . </span>

    We use Tatyana’s ability to create beauty and comfort on our site. She is a true master of her craft. She knows plants very well, she is excellent at creating harmonious compositions combining color, texture and shape.
           And one more important skill is arranging compositions with stones. We now have a beautiful Japanese mini rock garden and rock garden. In addition, it was important for us to weave our own ideas and thoughts into the design -
Tatiana did an excellent job with this! We are sincerely grateful to her for her work and for the time she spent with us!
